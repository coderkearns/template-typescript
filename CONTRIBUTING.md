# Contributing

All contributors (be it those opening a pull request, making an issue, or just interacting with the community) are expected to be kind and constructive. Any harassment or inappropriate conduct will not be tolerated.

That aside, here's how you can contribute:

## Opening Issues

Please feel free to file issues about everything from bug reports to discussions about features to questions about possible uses!

There are not currently any templates for issues--they and other contribution helps will be organized as they are needed.

If you plan to open a pull request, please create an issue first to discuss any features or changes you'd like to me.

## Making Changes

Please start by creating an issue to discuss the changes you want to make.

To create a pull request:

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository, then clone your fork
2. Create a branch for your changes. The branch naming convention is listed [below](#naming-branches)
3. Make your changes
4. Push to your branch, then [make a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

### Naming Branches

Branches should generally be named with the following convention:

```
<issue number>-<hyphen separated name>
```
